## Project Overview

In Taiwan, the education system is rigorous, with a focus on exams. The GSAT exam determines college admissions, leading students to spend much of their childhood studying for it. This often comes at the expense of learning new skills and pursuing personal interests.
As I observe them for the past few years, I notice a concerning trend: many lack a clear vision for the future. Their focus seems fixed on school selection and scores, with aspirations revolving around desired colleges rather than genuine interests. This realization prompts me to consider how I might assist them in reflecting on their goals and devising strategies to achieve them.
The Goal app is designed to facilitate deep introspection and goal setting. It guides users to consider their life goals, identify necessary steps and actions, and incorporates motivational quotes. With the Goal app, students can shift their focus from studying for rankings to shaping their futures and striving toward personal aspirations.


## Features

- **Goal Setting**: Users can set and define their life goals within the app.
- **Reflection**: The app facilitates deep introspection, encouraging users to reflect on their aspirations and values.
- **Action Planning**: Users can identify necessary steps and actions required to achieve their goals.

- **Flexible Framework**: Offers a flexible framework that allows users to tailor goal-setting strategies to their individual preferences and circumstances.
- **Encouragement and Support**: Provides encouragement and support to users, fostering a positive mindset and resilience in the face of challenges.
- **Shift in Focus**: Aims to shift users' focus from solely academic achievements to personal growth and fulfillment, encouraging a balanced approach to life.
